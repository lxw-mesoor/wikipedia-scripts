Anarchism

Anarchism is a <a href="political philosophy">political philosophy</a> that advocates <a href="self-governance">self-governed</a> societies with voluntary institutions. These are often described as <a href="stateless society">stateless societies</a>, but several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non-<a href="Hierarchy">hierarchical</a> <a href="Free association (communism and anarchism)">free associations</a>. Anarchism holds the <a href="state (polity)">state</a> to be undesirable, unnecessary, or harmful. While <a href="anti-statism">anti-statism</a> is central, anarchism entails opposing <a href="authority">authority</a> or <a href="hierarchical organisation">hierarchical organisation</a> in the conduct of human relations, including, but not limited to, the state system.
Anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy. Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy. There are many types and traditions of anarchism, not all of which are mutually exclusive. <a href="Anarchist schools of thought">Anarchist schools of thought</a> can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme <a href="individualism">individualism</a> to complete collectivism. Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of <a href="social anarchism">social</a> and <a href="individualist anarchism">individualist anarchism</a> or similar dual classifications. Anarchism is usually considered a radical <a href="left-wing">left-wing</a> ideology, and much of <a href="anarchist economics">anarchist economics</a> and <a href="anarchist law">anarchist legal philosophy</a> reflect <a href="Libertarian socialism">anti-authoritarian interpretations</a> of <a href="anarcho-communism">communism</a>, <a href="collectivist anarchism">collectivism</a>, <a href="anarcho-syndicalism">syndicalism</a>, <a href="Mutualism (economic theory)">mutualism</a>, or <a href="participatory economics">participatory economics</a>.
Etymology and terminology.
The term "<a href="wikt:anarchism">anarchism</a>" is a compound word composed from the word "<a href="anarchy">anarchy</a>" and the suffix "<a href="-ism">-ism</a>", themselves derived respectively from the Greek , i.e. "anarchy" (from , "anarchos", meaning "one without rulers"; from the <a href="privative">privative</a> prefix <a href="privative alpha">ἀν</a>- ("an-", i.e. "without") and , "archos", i.e. "leader", "ruler"; (cf. "<a href="archon">archon</a>" or , "arkhē", i.e. "authority", "sovereignty", "realm", "magistracy")) and the suffix or ("-ismos", "-isma", from the verbal <a href="infinitive">infinitive</a> suffix -ίζειν, "-izein"). The first known use of this word was in 1539. Various factions within the <a href="French Revolution">French Revolution</a> labelled opponents as anarchists (as <a href="Maximilien de Robespierre">Robespierre</a> did the <a href="Hébertists">Hébertists</a>) although few shared many views of later anarchists. There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, such as <a href="William Godwin">William Godwin</a> and <a href="Wilhelm Weitling">Wilhelm Weitling</a>, but they did not use the word "anarchist" or "anarchism" in describing themselves or their beliefs.
The first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was <a href="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>, marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-nineteenth century. Since the 1890s, and beginning in France, the term "libertarianism" has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1950s in the United States; its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States. On the other hand, some use "<a href="libertarianism">libertarianism</a>" to refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only, referring to free-market anarchism as "<a href="libertarian anarchism">libertarian anarchism</a>".
History.
Origins.
The earliest anarchist themes can be found in the 6th century BC, among the works of <a href="Taoism">Taoist</a> philosopher <a href="Laozi">Laozi</a>, and in later centuries by <a href="Zhuang Zhou">Zhuangzi</a> and Bao Jingyan. Zhuangzi's philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist. Zhuangzi wrote, "A petty thief is put in jail. A great <a href="wikt:brigand">brigand</a> becomes a ruler of a Nation." <a href="Diogenes of Sinope">Diogenes of Sinope</a> and the <a href="Cynicism (philosophy)">Cynics</a>, their contemporary <a href="Zeno of Citium">Zeno of Citium</a>, the founder of <a href="Stoicism">Stoicism</a>, also introduced similar topics. <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the <a href="Christian anarchism">Christian anarchist</a> tradition. Georges Lechartier wrote that "The true founder of anarchy was Jesus <a href="Christ">Christ</a> and ... the first anarchist society was that of the <a href="Apostle (Christian)">apostles</a>." In early <a href="History of Islam">Islamic history</a>, some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the <a href="Second Fitna">Islamic civil war</a> over the <a href="Caliphate">Caliphate</a>, where the <a href="Kharijites">Kharijites</a> insisted that the <a href="imamate">imamate</a> is a right for each individual within the Islamic society. Later, some <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> scholars, such as Amer al-Basri and <a href="Abu Hanifa">Abu Hanifa</a>, led movements of boycotting the rulers, paving the way to the <a href="waqf">waqf</a> (endowments) tradition, which served as an alternative to and asylum from the centralized authorities of the emirs. But such interpretations reverberates subversive religious conceptions like the aforementioned seemingly anarchistic Taoist teachings and that of other anti-authoritarian religious traditions creating a complex relationship regarding the question as to whether or not <a href="Anarchism and religion">anarchism and religion are compatible</a>. This is exemplified when the glorification of the state is viewed as a form of sinful <a href="idolatry">idolatry</a>.
The French <a href="Renaissance humanism">renaissance</a> political philosopher <a href="Étienne de La Boétie">Étienne de La Boétie</a> wrote in his most famous work the "Discourse on Voluntary Servitude" what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent. The radical <a href="Protestant Christianity">Protestant Christian</a> <a href="Gerrard Winstanley">Gerrard Winstanley</a> and his group the <a href="Diggers">Diggers</a> are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in England. The term "anarchist" first entered the English language in 1642, during the <a href="English Civil War">English Civil War</a>, as a <a href="Pejorative">term of abuse</a>, used by <a href="Cavalier">Royalists</a> against their <a href="Roundhead">Roundhead</a> opponents. By the time of the <a href="French Revolution">French Revolution</a> some, such as the "<a href="Enragés">Enragés</a>", began to use the term positively, in opposition to <a href="Jacobin (politics)">Jacobin</a> centralisation of power, seeing "revolutionary government" as <a href="oxymoron">oxymoronic</a>. By the turn of the 19th century, the English word "anarchism" had lost its initial negative connotation.
Modern anarchism sprang from the secular or religious thought of the <a href="Age of Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a>, particularly <a href="Jean-Jacques Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>'s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.
As part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the <a href="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>, <a href="William Godwin">William Godwin</a> developed the first expression of <a href="anarchist schools of thought">modern anarchist thought</a>. Godwin was, according to <a href="Peter Kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</a>, "the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work", while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early <a href="Edmund Burke">Edmund Burke</a>.
Godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as 'philosophical anarchism'. He argued in "<a href="Political Justice">Political Justice</a>" (1793) that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society, and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance. He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power. Rather, he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.
His aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the people’s ‘mental enslavement’, the foundations of law, <a href="property rights">property rights</a> and even the institution of marriage. He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgment.
The French <a href="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> is regarded as the first "self-proclaimed" anarchist, a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work, "<a href="What is Property?">What is Property?</a>," published in 1840. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory. He developed the theory of <a href="spontaneous order">spontaneous order</a> in society, where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests; his famous quote on the matter is, "Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order." In "What is Property?" Proudhon answers with the famous accusation "<a href="Property is theft">Property is theft</a>." In this work, he opposed the institution of decreed "property" ("propriété"), where owners have complete rights to "use and abuse" their property as they wish. He contrasted this with what he called "possession," or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use. Later, however, Proudhon added that "Property is Liberty," and argued that it was a bulwark against state power. His opposition to the state, organised religion, and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists, and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time.
The anarcho-communist <a href="Joseph Déjacque">Joseph Déjacque</a> was the first person to describe himself as "<a href="libertarian socialism">libertarian</a>". Unlike <a href="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>, he argued that, "it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature." and <a href="Pierre Joseph Proudhon">Pierre Joseph Proudhon</a>.
Criticisms.
Criticisms of anarchism include <a href="morality">moral</a> criticisms and pragmatic criticisms. Anarchism is often evaluated as unfeasible or <a href="utopian">utopian</a> by its critics. European history professor Carl Landauer, in his book "European Socialism" argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a "lesser evil" than a society without "repressive force." He also argued that "ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears" is an "absurdity."

Freemasonry

Freemasonry consists of <a href="Fraternity">fraternal organisations</a> that trace their origins to the local fraternities of <a href="Stonemasonry">stonemasons</a>, which from the end of the fourteenth century regulated the qualifications of stonemasons and their interaction with authorities and clients. The degrees of freemasonry retain the three grades of medieval craft <a href="guild">guilds</a>, those of <a href="Apprenticeship">Apprentice</a>, <a href="Journeyman">Journeyman</a> or fellow (now called Fellowcraft), and <a href="Master craftsman">Master Mason</a>. These are the degrees offered by Craft (or Blue Lodge) Freemasonry. Members of these organisations are known as Freemasons or Masons. There are additional degrees, which vary with locality and jurisdiction, and are usually administered by different bodies than the craft degrees. 
The basic, local organisational unit of Freemasonry is the <a href="Masonic Lodge">Lodge</a>. The Lodges are usually supervised and governed at the regional level (usually coterminous with either a state, province, or national border) by a <a href="Grand Lodge">Grand Lodge</a> or Grand Orient. There is no international, world-wide Grand Lodge that supervises all of Freemasonry; each Grand Lodge is independent, and they do not necessarily recognise each other as being legitimate.
Masonic Lodge.
The <a href="Masonic Lodge">Masonic Lodge</a> is the basic organisational unit of Freemasonry. The Lodge meets regularly to conduct the usual formal business of any small organisation (pay bills, organise social and charitable events, elect new members, etc.). In addition to business, the meeting may perform a ceremony to confer a <a href="Masonic ritual and symbolism">Masonic degree</a> or receive a lecture, which is usually on some aspect of Masonic history or ritual. At the conclusion of the meeting, the Lodge might adjourn for a formal dinner, or "festive board", sometimes involving toasting and song.
The bulk of <a href="Masonic ritual">Masonic ritual</a> consists of degree ceremonies. Candidates for Freemasonry are progressively "initiated" into Freemasonry, first in the degree of Entered Apprentice. Some time later, in a separate ceremony, they will be "passed" to the degree of Fellowcraft, and finally they will be "raised" to the degree of Master Mason. In all of these ceremonies, the candidate is entrusted with passwords, signs and grips peculiar to his new rank. Another ceremony is the annual installation of the Master and officers of the Lodge. In some jurisdictions "Installed Master" is valued as a separate rank, with its own secrets to distinguish its members. In other jurisdictions, the grade is not recognised, and no inner ceremony conveys new secrets during the installation of a new Master of the Lodge.
Most Lodges have some sort of social calendar, allowing Masons and their partners to meet in a less ritualised environment. Often coupled with these events is the obligation placed on every Mason to contribute to charity. This occurs at both Lodge and Grand Lodge level. Masonic charities contribute to many fields from education to disaster relief.
These private local Lodges form the backbone of Freemasonry, and a Freemason will necessarily have been initiated into one of these. There also exist specialist Lodges where Masons meet to celebrate anything from sport to Masonic research. The rank of Master Mason also entitles a Freemason to explore Masonry further through other degrees, administered separately from the Craft, or "Blue Lodge" degrees described here, but having a similar format to their meetings.
There is very little consistency in Freemasonry. Because each Masonic jurisdiction is independent, each sets its own procedures. The wording of the ritual, the number of officers present, the layout of the meeting room, etc. varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
The <a href="Masonic Lodge Officers">officers of the Lodge</a> are elected or appointed annually. Every Masonic Lodge has a Master, two Wardens, a secretary and a treasurer. There is also a <a href="Tyler (Masonic)">Tyler</a>, or outer guard, who is always present outside the door of a working Lodge. Other offices vary between jurisdictions.
Each Masonic Lodge exists and operates according to a set of ancient principles known as the "Landmarks of Freemasonry". These principles have thus far eluded any universally accepted definition.
Joining a Lodge.
Candidates for Freemasonry will have met most active members of the Lodge they are joining before they are initiated. The process varies between jurisdictions, but the candidate will typically have been introduced by a friend at a Lodge social function, or at some form of open evening in the Lodge. In modern times, interested people often track down a local Lodge through the Internet. The onus is on candidates to ask to join; while candidates may be encouraged to ask, they are never invited. Once the initial inquiry is made, an interview usually follows to determine the candidate's suitability. If the candidate decides to proceed from here, the Lodge ballots on the application before he (or she, depending on the Masonic Jurisdiction) can be accepted.
The absolute minimum requirement of any body of Freemasons is that the candidate must be free, and considered to be of good character. There is usually an age requirement, varying greatly between Grand Lodges, and (in some jurisdictions) capable of being overridden by a dispensation from the Grand Lodge. The underlying assumption is that the candidate should be a mature adult.
In addition, most Grand Lodges require the candidate to declare a belief in a <a href="Supreme Being">Supreme Being</a>. In a few cases, the candidate may be required to be of a specific religion. The form of Freemasonry most common in Scandinavia (known as the <a href="Swedish Rite">Swedish Rite</a>), for example, accepts only Christians. At the other end of the spectrum, "Liberal" or <a href="Continental Freemasonry">Continental Freemasonry</a>, exemplified by the <a href="Grand Orient de France">Grand Orient de France</a>, does not require a declaration of belief in any deity, and accepts atheists (a cause of discord with the rest of Freemasonry).
During the ceremony of initiation, the candidate is expected to swear (usually on a volume of sacred text appropriate to his personal religious faith) to fulfil certain obligations as a Mason. In the course of three degrees, new masons will promise to keep the secrets of their degree from lower degrees and outsiders, and to support a fellow Mason in distress (as far as practicality and the law permit). There is instruction as to the duties of a Freemason, but on the whole, Freemasons are left to explore the craft in the manner they find most satisfying. Some will further explore the ritual and symbolism of the craft, others will focus their involvement on the social side of the Lodge, while still others will concentrate on the charitable functions of the lodge.
Organisation.
Grand Lodges.
Grand Lodges and Grand Orients are independent and sovereign bodies that govern Masonry in a given country, state, or geographical area (termed a "jurisdiction"). There is no single overarching governing body that presides over worldwide Freemasonry; connections between different jurisdictions depend solely on mutual recognition.
Freemasonry, as it exists in various forms all over the world, has a membership estimated by the <a href="United Grand Lodge of England">United Grand Lodge of England</a> at around six million worldwide. The fraternity is administratively organised into independent <a href="Grand Lodge">Grand Lodges</a> (or sometimes Grand Orients), each of which governs its own Masonic jurisdiction, which consists of subordinate (or "constituent") Lodges. The largest single jurisdiction, in terms of membership, is the <a href="United Grand Lodge of England">United Grand Lodge of England</a> (with a membership estimated at around a quarter million). The <a href="Grand Lodge of Scotland">Grand Lodge of Scotland</a> and <a href="Grand Lodge of Ireland">Grand Lodge of Ireland</a> (taken together) have approximately 150,000 members. In the United States total membership is just under two million.
Recognition, amity and regularity.
Relations between Grand Lodges are determined by the concept of "Recognition". Each Grand Lodge maintains a list of other Grand Lodges that it recognises. When two Grand Lodges recognise and are in Masonic communication with each other, they are said to be "<a href="wikt:amity">in amity</a>", and the brethren of each may visit each other's Lodges and interact Masonically. When two Grand Lodges are not in amity, inter-visitation is not allowed. There are many reasons why one Grand Lodge will withhold or withdraw recognition from another, but the two most common are "Exclusive Jurisdiction" and "Regularity".
Exclusive Jurisdiction.
Exclusive Jurisdiction is a concept whereby only one Grand Lodge will be recognised in any geographical area. If two Grand Lodges claim jurisdiction over the same area, the other Grand Lodges will have to choose between them, and they may not all decide to recognise the same one. (In 1849, for example, the Grand Lodge of New York split into two rival factions, each claiming to be the legitimate Grand Lodge. Other Grand Lodges had to choose between them until the schism was healed.) Exclusive Jurisdiction can be waived when the two over-lapping Grand Lodges are themselves in Amity and agree to share jurisdiction (for example, since the Grand Lodge of Connecticut is in Amity with the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Connecticut, the principle of Exclusive Jurisdiction does not apply, and other Grand Lodges may recognise both).
Regularity.
Regularity is a concept based on adherence to <a href="Masonic Landmarks">Masonic Landmarks</a>, the basic membership requirements, tenets and rituals of the craft. Each Grand Lodge sets its own definition of what these landmarks are, and thus what is Regular and what is Irregular (and the definitions do not necessarily agree between Grand Lodges). Essentially, every Grand Lodge will hold that "its" landmarks (its requirements, tenets and rituals) are Regular, and judge other Grand Lodges based on those. If the differences are significant, one Grand Lodge may declare the other "Irregular" and withdraw or withhold recognition.
The most commonly shared rules for Recognition (based on Regularity) are those given by the United Grand Lodge of England in 1929:
Other degrees, orders and bodies.
Blue Lodge Freemasonry offers only three traditional degrees, and in most jurisdictions, the rank of past or installed master. Master Masons are also able to extend their Masonic experience by taking further degrees, in appendant bodies approved by their own Grand Lodge.
The Ancient and Accepted <a href="Scottish Rite">Scottish Rite</a> is a system of 33 degrees (including the three Blue Lodge degrees) administered by a local or national Supreme Council. This system is popular in North America and in Continental Europe. The <a href="York Rite">York Rite</a>, with a similar range, administers three orders of Masonry, namely the <a href="Royal Arch Masonry">Royal Arch</a>, <a href="Cryptic Masonry">Cryptic Masonry</a> and <a href="Knights Templar (Freemasonry)">Knights Templar</a>.
In Britain, separate bodies administer each order. Freemasons are encouraged to join the <a href="Holy Royal Arch">Holy Royal Arch</a>, which is linked to <a href="Order of Mark Master Masons">Mark Masonry</a> in Scotland and Ireland, but separate in England. Templar and Cryptic Masonry also exist.
In the <a href="Nordic countries">Nordic countries</a> the <a href="Swedish Rite">Swedish Rite</a> is dominant; a variation of it is also used in parts of <a href="Germany">Germany</a>.
Ritual and symbolism.
Freemasonry describes itself as a "'beautiful system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols". The symbolism is mainly, but not exclusively, drawn from the manual tools of stonemasons – the <a href="square and compasses">square and compasses</a>, the level and plumb rule, the <a href="trowel">trowel</a>, among others. A moral lesson is attached to each of these tools, although the assignment is by no means consistent. The meaning of the symbolism is taught and explored through ritual.
All Freemasons begin their journey in the "craft" by being progressively "initiated, passed "and" raised" into the three degrees of Craft, or Blue Lodge Masonry. During these three rituals, the candidate is progressively taught the meanings of the Lodge symbols, and entrusted with grips, signs and words to signify to other Masons that he has been so initiated. The initiations are part allegory and part lecture, and revolve around the construction of the <a href="Temple of Solomon">Temple of Solomon</a>, and the artistry and death of his chief architect, <a href="Hiram Abiff">Hiram Abiff</a>. The degrees are those of "Entered apprentice, Fellowcraft" and "Master Mason". While many different versions of these rituals exist, with at least two different lodge layouts and versions of the Hiram myth, each version is recognisable to any Freemason from any jurisdiction.
In some jurisdictions the main themes of each degree are illustrated by <a href="tracing board">tracing boards</a>. These painted depictions of Masonic themes are exhibited in the lodge according to which degree is being worked, and are explained to the candidate to illustrate the legend and symbolism of each degree.
The idea of Masonic brotherhood probably descends from a 16th-century legal definition of a "brother" as one who has taken an oath of mutual support to another. Accordingly, Masons swear at each degree to keep the contents of that degree secret, and to support and protect their brethren unless they have broken the law. In most Lodges the oath or obligation is taken on a "<a href="Volume of Sacred Law">Volume of Sacred Law</a>", whichever book of divine revelation is appropriate to the religious beliefs of the individual brother (usually the Bible in the Anglo-American tradition). In "Progressive" continental Freemasonry, books other than scripture are permissible, a cause of rupture between Grand Lodges.
History.
Origins.
Since the middle of the 19th century, Masonic historians have sought the origins of the movement in a series of similar documents known as the <a href="Masonic manuscripts">Old Charges</a>, dating from the <a href="Masonic manuscripts">Regius Poem</a> in about 1425 to the beginning of the 18th century. Alluding to the membership of a lodge of operative masons, they relate a mythologised history of the craft, the duties of its grades, and the manner in which oaths of fidelity are to be taken on joining. The fifteenth century also sees the first evidence of ceremonial regalia.
There is no clear mechanism by which these local trade organisations became today's Masonic Lodges, but the earliest rituals and passwords known, from operative lodges around the turn of the 17th–18th centuries, show continuity with the rituals developed in the later 18th century by accepted or speculative Masons, as those members who did not practice the physical craft came to be known. The minutes of the <a href="Lodge of Edinburgh (Mary's Chapel) No. 1">Lodge of Edinburgh (Mary's Chapel) No. 1</a> in Scotland show a continuity from an operative lodge in 1598 to a modern speculative Lodge. It is reputed to be the oldest Masonic Lodge in the world.
The first Grand Lodge, the Grand Lodge of London and Westminster (later called the <a href="Premier Grand Lodge of England">Grand Lodge of England</a> (GLE)), was founded on 24 June 1717, when four existing London Lodges met for a joint dinner. Many English Lodges joined the new regulatory body, which itself entered a period of self-publicity and expansion. However, many Lodges could not endorse changes which some Lodges of the GLE made to the ritual (they came to be known as the Moderns), and a few of these formed a rival Grand Lodge on 17 July 1751, which they called the "<a href="Antient Grand Lodge of England">Antient Grand Lodge of England</a>." These two Grand Lodges vied for supremacy until the Moderns promised to return to the ancient ritual. They united on 27 December 1813 to form the <a href="United Grand Lodge of England">United Grand Lodge of England</a> (UGLE).
The <a href="Grand Lodge of Ireland">Grand Lodge of Ireland</a> and the <a href="Grand Lodge of Scotland">Grand Lodge of Scotland</a> were formed in 1725 and 1736 respectively, although neither persuaded all of the existing lodges in their countries to join for many years.
North America.
The earliest known American lodges were in Pennsylvania. The Collector for the port of Pennsylvania, John Moore, wrote of attending lodges there in 1715, two years before the formation of the first Grand Lodge in London. The <a href="Premier Grand Lodge of England">Premier Grand Lodge of England</a> appointed a Provincial Grand Master for North America in 1731, based in Pennsylvania. Other lodges in the colony obtained authorisations from the later <a href="Antient Grand Lodge of England">Antient Grand Lodge of England</a>, the <a href="Grand Lodge of Scotland">Grand Lodge of Scotland</a>, and the <a href="Grand Lodge of Ireland">Grand Lodge of Ireland</a>, which was particularly well represented in the travelling lodges of the British Army. Many lodges came into existence with no warrant from any Grand Lodge, applying and paying for their authorisation only after they were confident of their own survival.
After the <a href="American Revolution">American Revolution</a>, independent U.S. Grand Lodges formed themselves within each state. Some thought was briefly given to organising an overarching "Grand Lodge of the United States," with <a href="George Washington">George Washington</a> (who was a member of a Virginian lodge) as the first Grand Master, but the idea was short-lived. The various state Grand Lodges did not wish to diminish their own authority by agreeing to such a body.
Prince Hall Freemasonry.
Prince Hall Freemasonry exists because of the refusal of early American lodges to admit <a href="African-American">African-Americans</a>. In 1775, an African-American named <a href="Prince Hall">Prince Hall</a>, along with fourteen other African-Americans, was initiated into a British military lodge with a warrant from the <a href="Grand Lodge of Ireland">Grand Lodge of Ireland</a>, having failed to obtain admission from the other lodges in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>. When the military Lodge left North America, those fifteen men were given the authority to meet as a Lodge, but not to initiate Masons. In 1784, these individuals obtained a Warrant from the Premier Grand Lodge of England (GLE) and formed African Lodge, Number 459. When the UGLE was formed in 1813, all U.S.-based Lodges were stricken from their rolls – due largely to the <a href="War of 1812">War of 1812</a>. Thus, separated from both UGLE and any concordantly recognised U.S. Grand Lodge, African Lodge re-titled itself as the African Lodge, Number 1 – and became a "de facto" "Grand Lodge" (this Lodge is not to be confused with the various Grand Lodges on the Continent of <a href="Africa">Africa</a>). As with the rest of U.S. Freemasonry, Prince Hall Freemasonry soon grew and organised on a Grand Lodge system for each state.
Widespread <a href="Racial segregation">segregation</a> in 19th- and early 20th-century North America made it difficult for African-Americans to join Lodges outside of Prince Hall jurisdictions – and impossible for inter-jurisdiction recognition between the parallel U.S. Masonic authorities. By the 1980s, such discrimination was a thing of the past, and today most U.S. Grand Lodges recognise their Prince Hall counterparts, and the authorities of both traditions are working towards full recognition. The United Grand Lodge of England has no problem with recognising Prince Hall Grand Lodges. While celebrating their heritage as lodges of black Americans, Prince Hall is open to all men regardless of race or religion.
Emergence of Continental Freemasonry.
English Freemasonry spread to France in the 1720s, first as lodges of expatriates and exiled Jacobites, and then as distinctively French lodges which still follow the ritual of the <a href="Premier Grand Lodge of England">Moderns</a>. From France and England, Freemasonry spread to most of Continental Europe during the course of the 18th century. The Grande Loge de France formed under the Grand Mastership of the Duke of Clermont, who exercised only nominal authority. His successor, the <a href="Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans">Duke of Orléans</a>, reconstituted the central body as the Grand Orient de France in 1773. Briefly eclipsed during the <a href="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>, French Freemasonry continued to grow in the next century.
Schism.
The ritual form on which the Grand Orient of France was based was abolished in England in the events leading to the formation of the <a href="United Grand Lodge of England">United Grand Lodge of England</a> in 1813. However the two jurisdictions continued in amity (mutual recognition) until events of the 1860s and 1870s drove a seemingly permanent wedge between them. In 1868 the "Supreme Council of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of the State of Louisiana" appeared in the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Louisiana, recognised by the Grand Orient de France, but regarded by the older body as an invasion of their jurisdiction. The new Scottish rite body admitted blacks, and the resolution of the Grand Orient the following year that neither colour, race, nor religion could disqualify a man from Masonry prompted the Grand Lodge to withdraw recognition, and it persuaded other American Grand Lodges to do the same.
A dispute during the <a href="Lausanne Congress of Supreme Councils of 1875">Lausanne Congress of Supreme Councils of 1875</a> prompted the Grand Orient de France to commission a report by a Protestant pastor which concluded that, as Freemasonry was not a religion, it should not require a religious belief. The new constitutions read, "Its principles are absolute liberty of conscience and human solidarity", the existence of God and the immortality of the soul being struck out. It is possible that the immediate objections of the United Grand Lodge of England were at least partly motivated by the political tension between France and Britain at the time. The result was the withdrawal of recognition of the Grand Orient of France by the United Grand Lodge of England, a situation that continues today.
Not all French lodges agreed with the new wording. In 1894, lodges favouring the compulsory recognition of the Great Architect of the Universe formed the <a href="Grande Loge de France">Grande Loge de France</a>. In 1913, the United Grand Lodge of England recognised a new Grand Lodge of Regular Freemasons, a Grand Lodge that follows a similar rite to Anglo-American Freemasonry with a mandatory belief in a deity.
There are now three strands of Freemasonry in France, which extend into the rest of Continental Europe:-
The term <a href="Continental Freemasonry">Continental Freemasonry</a> was used in Mackey's 1873 Encyclopedia of Freemasonry to "designate the Lodges on the Continent of Europe which retain many usages which have either been abandoned by, or never were observed in, the Lodges of England, Ireland, and Scotland, as well as the United States of America". Today, it is frequently used to refer to only the Liberal jurisdictions typified by the Grand Orient de France.
The majority of Freemasonry considers the Liberal (Continental) strand to be Irregular, and thus withhold recognition. For the Continental lodges, however, having a different approach to Freemasonry was not a reason for severing masonic ties. In 1961, an umbrella organisation, <a href="Centre de Liaison et d'Information des Puissances maçonniques Signataires de l'Appel de Strasbourg">Centre de Liaison et d'Information des Puissances maçonniques Signataires de l'Appel de Strasbourg</a> (CLIPSAS) was set up, which today provides a forum for most of these Grand Lodges and Grand Orients worldwide. Included in the list of over 70 Grand Lodges and Grand Orients are representatives of all three of the above categories, including mixed and women's organisations. The United Grand Lodge of England does not communicate with any of these jurisdictions, and expects its allies to follow suit. This creates the distinction between Anglo-American and Continental Freemasonry.
Freemasonry and women.
The status of women in the old guilds and corporations of mediaeval masons remains uncertain. The principle of "femme sole" allowed a widow to continue the trade of her husband, but its application had wide local variations, ranging from full membership of a trade body to limited trade by deputation to approved members of that body. In masonry, the small available evidence points to the less empowered end of the scale.
At the dawn of the <a href="History of Freemasonry#Early Grand Lodge Period">Grand Lodge era</a>, during the 1720s, <a href="James Anderson (Freemason)">James Anderson</a> composed the <a href="Anderson's Constitutions">first printed constitutions for Freemasons</a>, the basis for most subsequent constitutions, which specifically excluded women from Freemasonry. As Freemasonry spread, continental masons began to include their ladies in <a href="Rite of Adoption">Lodges of Adoption</a>, which worked three degrees with the same names as the men's but different content. The French officially abandoned the experiment in the early 19th century. Later organisations with a similar aim emerged in the United States, but distinguished the names of the degrees from those of male masonry.
<a href="Maria Deraismes">Maria Deraismes</a> was initiated into Freemasonry in 1882, then resigned to allow her lodge to rejoin their Grand Lodge. Having failed to achieve acceptance from any masonic governing body, she and <a href="Georges Martin (freemason)">Georges Martin</a> started a mixed masonic lodge that actually worked masonic ritual. <a href="Annie Besant">Annie Besant</a> spread the phenomenon to the English speaking world. Disagreements over ritual led to the formation of exclusively female bodies of Freemasons in England, which spread to other countries. Meanwhile, the French had re-invented Adoption as an all-female lodge in 1901, only to cast it aside again in 1935. The lodges, however, continued to meet, which gave rise, in 1959, to a body of women practising continental Freemasonry.
In general, Continental Freemasonry is sympathetic to Freemasonry amongst women, dating from the 1890s when French lodges assisted the emergent co-masonic movement by promoting enough of their members to the 33rd degree of the <a href="Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite">Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite</a> to allow them, in 1899, to form their own grand council, recognised by the other Continental Grand Councils of that Rite. The United Grand Lodge of England issued a statement in 1999 recognising the two women's grand lodges there to be regular in all but the participants. While they were not, therefore, recognised as regular, they were part of Freemasonry "in general". The attitude of most regular Anglo-American grand lodges remains that women Freemasons are not legitimate Masons.
Anti-Masonry.
"<a href="Anti-Masonry">Anti-Masonry</a>" (alternatively called "Anti-Freemasonry") has been defined as "opposition to Freemasonry", but there is no homogeneous anti-Masonic movement. Anti-Masonry consists of widely differing criticisms from diverse (and often incompatible) groups who are hostile to Freemasonry in some form. Critics have included religious groups, political groups, and <a href="conspiracy theorists">conspiracy theorists</a>.
There have been many disclosures and exposés dating as far back as the 18th century. These often lack context, may be outdated for various reasons, or could be outright <a href="hoax">hoaxes</a> on the part of the author, as in the case of the <a href="Taxil hoax">Taxil hoax</a>.
These hoaxes and exposés have often become the basis for criticism of Masonry, often religious or political in nature or are based on suspicion of corrupt conspiracy of some form. The political opposition that arose after the "<a href="William Morgan (anti-Mason)#The Morgan affair">Morgan Affair</a>" in 1826 gave rise to the term "Anti-Masonry", which is still in use today, both by Masons in referring to their critics and as a self-descriptor by the critics themselves.
Religious opposition.
Freemasonry has attracted criticism from <a href="theocracy">theocratic</a> states and organised religions for supposed competition with religion, or supposed <a href="heterodoxy">heterodoxy</a> within the fraternity itself, and has long been the target of <a href="Masonic conspiracy theories">conspiracy theories</a>, which assert Freemasonry to be an <a href="occult">occult</a> and evil power.
Christianity and Freemasonry.
Although members of various faiths cite objections, certain <a href="Christian">Christian</a> <a href="religious denomination">denominations</a> have had high profile negative attitudes to Masonry, banning or discouraging their members from being Freemasons.
The denomination with the longest history of objection to Freemasonry is the <a href="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>. The objections raised by the Roman Catholic Church are based on the allegation that Masonry teaches a naturalistic <a href="deistic">deistic</a> religion which is in conflict with Church <a href="doctrine">doctrine</a>. A number of Papal pronouncements have been issued against Freemasonry. The first was <a href="Pope Clement XII">Pope Clement XII</a>'s "<a href="In eminenti apostolatus">In eminenti apostolatus</a>," 28 April 1738; the most recent was <a href="Pope Leo XIII">Pope Leo XIII</a>'s "<a href="Ab apostolici">Ab apostolici</a>," 15 October 1890. The "<a href="1917 Code of Canon Law">1917 Code of Canon Law</a>" explicitly declared that joining Freemasonry entailed automatic <a href="excommunication">excommunication</a>, and banned books favouring Freemasonry.
In 1983, the Church issued a new code of <a href="Canon law (Catholic Church)">canon law</a>. Unlike its predecessor, the "<a href="1983 Code of Canon Law">1983 Code of Canon Law</a>" did not explicitly name Masonic orders among the <a href="secret societies">secret societies</a> it condemns. It states: "A person who joins an association which plots against the Church is to be punished with a just penalty; one who promotes or takes office in such an association is to be punished with an <a href="Interdict (Roman Catholic Church)">interdict</a>." This named omission of Masonic orders caused both Catholics and Freemasons to believe that the ban on Catholics becoming Freemasons may have been lifted, especially after the perceived liberalisation of <a href="Second Vatican Council">Vatican II</a>. However, the matter was clarified when Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later <a href="Pope Benedict XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a>), <a href="Joseph Ratzinger as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith">as the Prefect</a> of the <a href="Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith">Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith</a>, issued a <a href="Declaration on Masonic Associations">Declaration on Masonic Associations</a>, which states: "... the Church’s negative judgment in regard to Masonic association remains unchanged since their principles have always been considered irreconcilable with the doctrine of the Church and therefore membership in them remains forbidden. The faithful who enroll in Masonic associations are in a state of grave sin and may not receive <a href="Holy Communion">Holy Communion</a>." For its part, Freemasonry has never objected to Catholics joining their fraternity. Those Grand Lodges in amity with UGLE deny the Church's claims. The UGLE now states that "Freemasonry does not seek to replace a Mason’s religion or provide a substitute for it."
In contrast to Catholic allegations of rationalism and naturalism, Protestant objections are more likely to be based on allegations of <a href="mysticism">mysticism</a>, <a href="occultism">occultism</a>, and even <a href="Satanism">Satanism</a>. Masonic scholar <a href="Albert Pike">Albert Pike</a> is often quoted (in some cases misquoted) by Protestant anti-Masons as an authority for the position of Masonry on these issues. However, Pike, although undoubtedly learned, was not a spokesman for Freemasonry and was also controversial among Freemasons in general. His writings represented his personal opinion only, and furthermore an opinion grounded in the attitudes and understandings of late 19th century Southern Freemasonry of the USA. Notably, his book carries in the preface a form of disclaimer from his own Grand Lodge. No one voice has ever spoken for the whole of Freemasonry.
<a href="Free Methodist Church">Free Methodist Church</a> founder <a href="B.T. Roberts">B.T. Roberts</a> was a vocal opponent of Freemasonry in the mid 19th century. Roberts opposed the society on moral grounds and stated, "The god of the lodge is not the God of the Bible." Roberts believed Freemasonry was a "<a href="Greco-Roman mysteries">mystery</a>" or "alternate" religion and encouraged his church not to support ministers who were Freemasons. Freedom from secret societies is one of the "frees" upon which the Free Methodist Church was founded.
Since the founding of Freemasonry, many Bishops of the <a href="Church of England">Church of England</a> have been Freemasons, such as <a href="Archbishop">Archbishop</a> <a href="Geoffrey Fisher">Geoffrey Fisher</a>. In the past, few members of the Church of England would have seen any incongruity in concurrently adhering to Anglican Christianity and practicing Freemasonry. In recent decades, however, reservations about Freemasonry have increased within Anglicanism, perhaps due to the increasing prominence of the evangelical wing of the church. The former <a href="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, <a href="Rowan Williams">Dr Rowan Williams</a>, appeared to harbour some reservations about Masonic ritual, whilst being anxious to avoid causing offence to Freemasons inside and outside the Church of England. In 2003 he felt it necessary to apologise to British Freemasons after he said that their beliefs were incompatible with Christianity and that he had barred the appointment of Freemasons to senior posts in his diocese when he was Bishop of Monmouth.
In 1933, the <a href="Eastern Orthodox Church">Orthodox</a> <a href="Church of Greece">Church of Greece</a> officially declared that being a Freemason constitutes an act of <a href="Apostasy in Christianity">apostasy</a> and thus, until he repents, the person involved with Freemasonry cannot partake of the <a href="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>. This has been generally affirmed throughout the whole Eastern Orthodox Church. The Orthodox critique of Freemasonry agrees with both the Roman Catholic and Protestant versions: "Freemasonry cannot be at all compatible with Christianity as far as it is a secret organisation, acting and teaching in mystery and secret and deifying rationalism."
Regular Freemasonry has traditionally not responded to these claims, beyond the often repeated statement that those Grand Lodges in amity with UGLE explicitly adhere to the principle that "Freemasonry is not a religion, nor a substitute for religion. There is no separate 'Masonic deity,' and there is no separate proper name for a deity in Freemasonry."
Christian men, who were discouraged from joining the Freemasons by their Churches or who wanted a more religiocentric society, joined similar fraternal organizations, such as the <a href="Knights of Columbus">Knights of Columbus</a> for Catholic Christians, and the <a href="Orange Order">Loyal Orange Institution</a> for Protestant Christians, although these fraternal organizations have been "organized in part on the style of and use many symbols of Freemasonry".
Islam and Freemasonry.
Many <a href="Islamic">Islamic</a> anti-Masonic arguments are closely tied to both <a href="antisemitism">antisemitism</a> and <a href="Anti-Zionism">Anti-Zionism</a>, though other criticisms are made such as linking Freemasonry to al-<a href="Masih ad-Dajjal">Masih ad-Dajjal</a> (the false Messiah). Some Muslim anti-Masons argue that Freemasonry promotes the interests of the <a href="Jews">Jews</a> around the world and that one of its aims is to destroy the <a href="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a> in order to rebuild the <a href="Temple of Solomon">Temple of Solomon</a> in <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. In article 28 of its Covenant, <a href="Hamas">Hamas</a> states that Freemasonry, <a href="Rotary International">Rotary</a>, and other similar groups "work in the interest of Zionism and according to its instructions ..."
Many countries with a significant Muslim population do not allow Masonic establishments within their jurisdictions. However, countries such as <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> and <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a> have established Grand Lodges, while in countries such as <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> and <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a> there are District Grand Lodges operating under a warrant from an established Grand Lodge.
In Pakistan in 1972, <a href="Zulfikar Ali Bhutto">Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto</a>, then <a href="Prime Minister of Pakistan">Prime Minister of Pakistan</a>, placed a ban on Freemasonry. Lodge buildings were confiscated by the government.
Masonic lodges existed in <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a> as early as 1917, when the first lodge under the <a href="United Grand Lodge of England">United Grand Lodge of England</a> (UGLE) was opened. Nine lodges under UGLE existed by the 1950s, and a Scottish lodge was formed in 1923. However, the position changed following the revolution, and all lodges were forced to close in 1965. This position was later reinforced under <a href="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>; the death penalty was "prescribed" for those who "promote or acclaim Zionist principles, including freemasonry, or who associate with Zionist organisations."
Political opposition.
In 1799, English Freemasonry almost came to a halt due to Parliamentary proclamation. In the wake of the <a href="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>, the <a href="Unlawful Societies Act 1799">Unlawful Societies Act 1799</a> banned any meetings of groups that required their members to take an <a href="oath">oath</a> or obligation. The Grand Masters of both the Moderns and the Antients Grand Lodges called on Prime Minister William Pitt (who was not a Freemason) and explained to him that Freemasonry was a supporter of the law and lawfully constituted authority and was much involved in charitable work. As a result, Freemasonry was specifically exempted from the terms of the Act, provided that each private lodge's Secretary placed with the local "Clerk of the Peace" a list of the members of his lodge once a year. This continued until 1967 when the obligation of the provision was rescinded by <a href="Parliament of the United Kingdom">Parliament</a>.
Freemasonry in the United States faced political pressure following the 1826 kidnapping of <a href="William Morgan (anti-Mason)">William Morgan</a> by Freemasons and subsequent disappearance. Reports of the "Morgan Affair", together with opposition to <a href="Jacksonian democracy">Jacksonian democracy</a> (Andrew Jackson was a prominent Mason) helped fuel an Anti-Masonic movement, culminating in the formation of a short lived <a href="Anti-Masonic Party">Anti-Masonic Party</a> which fielded candidates for the Presidential elections of 1828 and 1832.
In Italy, Freemasonry has become linked to a scandal concerning the <a href="Propaganda Due">Propaganda Due</a> lodge (a.k.a. P2). This lodge was chartered by the <a href="Grande Oriente d'Italia">Grande Oriente d'Italia</a> in 1877, as a lodge for visiting Masons unable to attend their own lodges. Under <a href="Licio Gelli">Licio Gelli</a>’s leadership, in the late 1970s, P2 became involved in the financial scandals that nearly bankrupted the <a href="Vatican Bank">Vatican Bank</a>. However, by this time the lodge was operating independently and irregularly, as the Grand Orient had revoked its charter and expelled Gelli in 1976.
<a href="Conspiracy theorists">Conspiracy theorists</a> have long associated Freemasonry with the <a href="New World Order (conspiracy theory)">New World Order</a> and the <a href="Illuminati">Illuminati</a>, and state that Freemasonry as an organisation is either bent on world domination or already secretly in control of world politics. Historically, Freemasonry has attracted criticism—and suppression—from both the politically <a href="far right">far right</a> (e.g., <a href="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>) and the <a href="far left">far left</a> (e.g. the former <a href="Communist state">Communist states</a> in <a href="Eastern Europe">Eastern Europe</a>).
Even in modern democracies, Freemasonry is sometimes viewed with distrust. In the UK, Masons working in the justice system, such as judges and police officers, were from 1999 to 2009 required to disclose their membership. While a parliamentary inquiry found that there has been no evidence of wrongdoing, it was felt that any potential loyalties Masons might have, based on their vows to support fellow Masons, should be transparent to the public. The policy of requiring a declaration of masonic membership of applicants for judicial office (judges and magistrates) was ended in 2009 by <a href="Secretary of State for Justice">Justice Secretary</a> <a href="Jack Straw">Jack Straw</a> (who had initiated the requirement in the 1990s). Straw stated that the rule was considered disproportionate, since no impropriety or malpractice had been shown as a result of judges being Freemasons.
Freemasonry is both successful and controversial in France; membership is rising, but reporting in the popular media is often negative.
In some countries anti-Masonry is often related to <a href="antisemitism">antisemitism</a> and anti-<a href="Zionism">Zionism</a>. For example, In 1980, the <a href="Iraq">Iraqi</a> <a href="Law of Iraq">legal</a> and <a href="Iraqi Penal Code">penal code</a> was changed by <a href="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>'s ruling <a href="Ba'ath Party (Iraq)">Ba'ath Party</a>, making it a felony to "promote or acclaim Zionist principles, including Freemasonry, or who associate with Zionist organisations". Professor Andrew Prescott of the <a href="University of Sheffield">University of Sheffield</a> writes: "Since at least the time of the <a href="The Protocols of the Elders of Zion">Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a>, antisemitism has gone hand in hand with anti-masonry, so it is not surprising that allegations that <a href="11 September 2001 attacks">11 September</a> was a Zionist plot have been accompanied by suggestions that the attacks were inspired by a masonic world order".
The Holocaust.
The preserved records of the "<a href="RSHA">Reichssicherheitshauptamt</a>" (the Reich Security Main Office) show the persecution of Freemasons during <a href="the Holocaust">the Holocaust</a>. RSHA Amt VII (Written Records) was overseen by Professor <a href="Franz Six">Franz Six</a> and was responsible for "ideological" tasks, by which was meant the creation of antisemitic and anti-Masonic propaganda. While the number is not accurately known, it is estimated that between 80,000 and 200,000 Freemasons were killed under the <a href="Nacht und Nebel">Nazi regime</a>. Masonic concentration camp inmates were graded as political prisoners and wore an inverted <a href="Nazi concentration camp badges">red triangle</a>.
The small blue <a href="forget-me-not">forget-me-not</a> flower was first used by the Grand Lodge "Zur Sonne", in 1926, as a Masonic emblem at the annual convention in <a href="Bremen (city)">Bremen</a>, Germany. In 1938 a forget-me-not badge—made by the same factory as the Masonic badge—was chosen for the annual Nazi Party "<a href="Winterhilfswerk">Winterhilfswerk</a>", the annual charity drive of the <a href="National Socialist People's Welfare">National Socialist People's Welfare</a>, the welfare branch of the Nazi party. This coincidence enabled Freemasons to wear the forget-me-not badge as a secret sign of membership.
After <a href="World War II">World War II</a>, the forget-me-not flower was again used as a Masonic emblem at the first Annual Convention of the <a href="United Grand Lodges of Germany">United Grand Lodges of Germany</a> in 1948. The badge is now worn in the coat lapel by Freemasons around the world to remember all who suffered in the name of Freemasonry, especially those during the Nazi era.
