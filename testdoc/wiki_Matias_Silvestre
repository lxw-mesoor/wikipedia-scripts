<a href="Santana (band)">Santana</a> is a <a href="Latin rock">Latin rock</a> band formed in <a href="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, <a href="California">California</a> in 1967 by Mexican guitarist <a href="Carlos Santana">Carlos Santana</a>. The band first came to widespread public attention when their performance of " <a href="Soul Sacrifice (song)">Soul Sacrifice</a>" at <a href="Woodstock Festival">Woodstock</a> in 1969 provided a contrast to other acts on the bill. This exposure helped propel their first album, also named " <a href="Santana (1969 album)">Santana</a>", into a hit, followed in the next two years by the successful " <a href="Abraxas (album)">Abraxas</a>" and " <a href="Santana (1971 album)">Santana III</a>".
In the years that followed lineup changes were common. Carlos <a href="Santana (band)">Santana</a>'s increasing involvement with guru <a href="Sri Chinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> took the band into more esoteric music, though never quite losing its initial Latin influence.
In 1998, the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, with Carlos <a href="Santana (band)">Santana</a> <a href="José Areas">Jose Chepito Areas</a>, <a href="David Brown (musician)">David Brown</a>, <a href="Gregg Rolie">Gregg Rolie</a>, <a href="Mike Carabello">Mike Carabello</a> and <a href="Michael Shrieve">Michael Shrieve</a> being honored.
The band has earned eight Grammy Awards and three <a href="Latin Grammy Awards">Latin Grammy Awards</a>, the latter all in 2000. Carlos also won Grammy Awards as a solo artist in 1989 and 2003. "Santana" has sold more than 90 million records worldwide, making them one of the <a href="List of best-selling music artists">world’s best-selling groups of all time</a>. In 2013, <a href="Santana (band)">Santana</a> announced a reunion of the classic line-up for a new record, predicting a 2014 release. They are tied with having the most won Grammys in one night.
1967–72: Formation and peak years.
The band was formed in 1967 in <a href="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> as the Carlos <a href="Santana (band)">Santana</a> Blues Band with the help of Tom Fraser. The first established members were <a href="Carlos Santana">Carlos Santana</a> , <a href="Marcus Malone">Marcus Malone</a> , Rod Harper , <a href="David Brown (musician)">David Brown</a> and <a href="Gregg Rolie">Gregg Rolie</a> (lead vocals, <a href="Hammond Organ#B-3 / C-3 / RT-3 / A-100 / D-100 / E-100 / H-100 series">Hammond Organ B3</a>). The group's first audition with this line up was at the Avalon Ballroom in the late summer of 1967. After the audition, <a href="Chet Helms">Chet Helms</a> , in concert with the Family Dog, told the band that they would never make <a href="Santana (band)">it</a> in the San Francisco Music Scene playing Latin fusion and suggested Carlos keep his day job washing dishes at Tick Tock's Drive-In on 3rd Street.
Woodstock and breakthrough.
Ahead of Woodstock, Bill Graham was asked to help with logistics and planning. Bill agreed to lend his help only if a new band he was championing, an unknown band called <a href="Santana (band)">Santana</a> was added to the bill. <a href="Santana (band)">Santana</a> was announced as one of the performers at the Woodstock Festival. The band started recording their 1969 debut album " <a href="Santana (1969 album)">Santana</a>" in May 1969 and finished <a href="Santana (band)">it</a> in a month.
<a href="Santana (band)">Santana</a> performed at the festival. Later that month, they released their debut album, which peaked at number 4 on the US <a href="Billboard 200">"Billboard" 200</a> pop chart with the single " <a href="Evil Ways">Evil Ways</a>" being a top 10 single in the US.
"Abraxas" and "Santana III".
<a href="Santana (band)">Santana</a> went on tour to promote their debut LP and started work on their next, " <a href="Abraxas (album)">Abraxas</a>". Work began in mid-April 1970 at <a href="Wally Heider Studios">Wally Heider Studios</a> in San Francisco and was completed in early May 1970. The album, highlighted by a cover of <a href="Fleetwood Mac">Fleetwood Mac</a>'s " <a href="Black Magic Woman">Black Magic Woman</a>" (written by Fleetwood Mac founder <a href="Peter Green (musician)">Peter Green</a>) that peaked at number 4 on the US <a href="Billboard Hot 100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a>, was released in September 1970 and rose to number 1 on the US <a href="Billboard 200">"Billboard" 200</a>.
From January to July 1971 <a href="Santana (band)">Santana</a> worked on " <a href="Santana (1971 album)">Santana III</a>". Released in September 1971, the album also reached number 1 on the US "Billboard" 200. At the peak of the band's popularity, the album was the last to feature its classic Woodstock era line-up.
Before recording their fourth album " <a href="Caravanserai (album)">Caravanserai</a>", there had been multiple line-up changes. Bassist <a href="David Brown (musician)">David Brown</a> left in 1971 before recording started and was replaced by Doug Rauch and Tom Rutley. Percussionist Michael Carabello left <a href="Santana (band)">Santana</a> and was replaced by Armando Peraza. Keyboardist/vocalist <a href="Gregg Rolie">Gregg Rolie</a> was replaced by <a href="Tom Coster">Tom Coster</a> on a few songs.
"Caravanserai" debuted at number 8 on the pop charts, despite not spawning a hit single.
1973–79: Experimentation and consolidation.
13 months after "Caravanserai", <a href="Santana (band)">Santana</a> released " <a href="Welcome (Santana album)">Welcome</a>". "Welcome" was the first of four consecutive albums to achieve gold certification, as opposed to the previous four, which all at least reached platinum status. The album was certainly a wake-up call for the band, as <a href="Santana (band)">it</a> peaked at number 25 on the "Billboard" 200, the lowest of the band's career so far. The next few albums contained a more experimental style than their previous work, beginning with " <a href="Borboletta">Borboletta</a>", which fared arguably worse than its predecessor, despite climbing five spots on the US charts.
The group's 1975 release, " <a href="Amigos (Santana album)">Amigos</a>", was far more successful. Reaching number 10 on the US charts, and also hitting the top 10 in France, Australia, New Zealand, Austria and The Netherlands, <a href="Santana (band)">it</a> was a form of return to the success of their early albums. " <a href="Festival">Festival</a>", somewhat contradicted that new-found success, but was a short blip before another successful album, " <a href="Moonflower (album)">Moonflower</a>", released in 1977. The album was possibly the most successful since "Santana III", achieving 2x platinum in the US, and being the first album since 1974's "Borboletta", to break the top 10 in the UK. <a href="Santana (band)">it</a> was characterized by a stylistic shift for the band, as <a href="Santana (band)">it</a> contained heavier influences from the more conventional sound of the group's early work, while still maintaining the experimental sound of their last few albums.
Their next two releases, " <a href="Inner Secrets">Inner Secrets</a>" and " <a href="Marathon (Santana album)">Marathon</a>", released in 1978 and '79, respectively, were a further musical shift for the band, moving away from the Latin-fused rock music that had characterized their work in the late 1960s and the majority of the '70s, to move towards a more album-oriented, conventional rock sound. These albums, however, fared poorly commercially, although both achieved gold status in the US.
1980–97: Commercial decline and seven-year hiatus.
The 1980s started relatively brightly for <a href="Santana (band)">Santana</a> with 1981's platinum-selling " <a href="Zebop!">Zebop!</a>", which also reached the top 20 in several countries, and continued the more conventional rock sound. The following year, <a href="Shangó (Santana album)">Shangó</a> was released; this album marked a steep decline in the band's commercial fortunes, although <a href="Santana (band)">it</a> achieved gold status.
The group waited another three years to release the follow-up, the longest break for them so far. 1985's " <a href="Beyond Appearances">Beyond Appearances</a>", was a commercial failure, and their first album not to achieve gold certification. Their following three releases all continued this commercial decline, with the last of these failing to break the "Billboard" top 100. In the midst of this commercial pitfall, the band stopped recording material for an unprecedented seven years but continued to tour.
1998–2001: Best-selling album, Grammy Awards, and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
In 1998, with the group still being on hiatus, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. This proved only to be the start of better things to come for Carlos <a href="Santana (band)">Santana</a> and his band. Their 1999 release, " <a href="Supernatural (Santana album)">Supernatural</a>", debuted at number 19 on the "Billboard" 200, but the album's appeal began to snowball, and within 18 weeks <a href="Santana (band)">it</a> topped the US charts.
The lead single released from the album, " <a href="Smooth (song)">Smooth</a>", hit the number one spot on the Hot 100, and sparked an unstoppable commercial frenzy, and by October 30 the album peaked at number one, and stayed there for 12 non-consecutive weeks. Not only was the album a hit in the US, <a href="Santana (band)">it</a> slowly began to spread worldwide, topping charts internationally. The second single released from the album, " <a href="Maria Maria">Maria Maria</a>" also hit the number one spot on the Hot 100. Eventually the album reached 15x platinum in the US, and sold 30 million copies worldwide. The album came 28 years after their last US number 1, which was " <a href="Santana (1971 album)">Santana</a>" in 1971, according to <a href="Guinness Book Of World Records">Guinness Book Of World Records</a>, this is the longest gap between US number one albums for the same artist.
Musically, the album was possibly the largest musical shift for the group. The album's predecessor, " <a href="Milagro (Santana album)">Milagro</a>", contained strong <a href="hard rock">hard rock</a> influences, as well as conventional influences of <a href="Latin rock">Latin rock</a>. However, "Supernatural", while still maintaining a Latin and blues rock influenced core, contained heavy influences from many popular genres of the time, most notably <a href="alternative rock">alternative rock</a>, and also <a href="pop rock">pop rock</a> and <a href="Contemporary R&B">R&B</a>. The album won nine Grammy Awards, including the award for <a href="Grammy Award for Album of the Year">Album of the Year</a>, and also won three <a href="Latin Grammy Awards">Latin Grammy Awards</a>, including <a href="Record of the Year">Record of the Year</a>.
Also noteworthy was the high amount of collaborations featured on the album, with the lead single containing the lead vocals of the highly popular <a href="Matchbox Twenty">Matchbox Twenty</a> singer, <a href="Rob Thomas (musician)">Rob Thomas</a>. The second number one hit was recorded in collaboration with <a href="the Product G&B">the Product G&B</a>, and another popular single from the album, " <a href="Put Your Lights On">Put Your Lights On</a>", featured hip-hop and alternative rock artist <a href="Everlast (musician)">Everlast</a>. Other guest artists include <a href="Eric Clapton">Eric Clapton</a>, <a href="Eagle-Eye Cherry">Eagle-Eye Cherry</a>, <a href="Lauryn Hill">Lauryn Hill</a>, <a href="Dave Matthews">Dave Matthews</a>, and <a href="Cee Lo Green">Cee-Lo</a>.
2002–12: Dealing with new-found success.
The follow-up to "Supernatural", came three years later, and was highly anticipated by the international media and fans alike. On October 22, 2002, " <a href="Shaman (album)">Shaman</a>" was released worldwide. Although <a href="Santana (band)">it</a> initially sold quickly, selling 298,973 copies in the US in its first week, and debuting at number 1 on the "Billboard" 200, the album's appeal quickly wore off, and <a href="Santana (band)">it</a> soon slid down the charts. Despite this, <a href="Santana (band)">it</a> went on to sell 2x platinum in the US, and achieved platinum status in several other countries including Australia. The first single released from the album, " <a href="The Game of Love (Santana song)">The Game of Love</a>", which featured vocals from <a href="Michelle Branch">Michelle Branch</a>, debuted at number 5 on the Hot 100. The album's next four singles failed to chart in most countries, but the final single, " <a href="Why Don't You & I">Why Don't You & I</a>", featuring the vocals of <a href="Alex Band">Alex Band</a>, reached number 8 on the Hot 100. Musically, the album was a return to a far more conventional sound for the group, with a mainly Latin rock-based sound.
With their renewed appeal worn off, another three-year wait saw another album released, 2005's " <a href="All That I Am (Santana album)">All That I Am</a>". The album debuted at number 2 on the "Billboard" 200, but fared worse internationally, and quickly lost appeal. <a href="Santana (band)">it</a> was a continuation of the Latin rock influenced sound that embodied "Shaman", and did, however, achieve gold certification in the US. A five-year break from recording saw the release of another studio album, 2010's " <a href="Guitar Heaven">Guitar Heaven</a>". Musically <a href="Santana (band)">it</a> was a drastic change for the band, with a far heavier sound at its core and strong <a href="Heavy metal music">heavy metal</a> influences. <a href="Santana (band)">it</a> debuted at number 5 on the "Billboard" 200 but marked another decline for the band, failing to achieve gold status.
In 2012 the group released " <a href="Shape Shifter (album)">Shape Shifter</a>", which returned to the conventional Latin rock sound, and was completely album-oriented, as no singles were released from it. <a href="Santana (band)">it</a> debuted at number 16 on the <a href="Billboard 200">Billboard 200</a>.
2013–present: Possible reunion of the classic line-up and "Corazón".
On 2 February 2013, Carlos <a href="Santana (band)">Santana</a> confirmed that he would reunite his classic line-up, most of whom played Woodstock with him in 1969. <a href="Santana (band)">Santana</a> stated that he is reuniting the group with the intention of recording new music. Confirmed for the reunion are Neal Schon, who was in the band in the early 1970s where he traded lead guitar work with <a href="Santana (band)">Santana</a> before leaving with founding <a href="Santana (band)">Santana</a> singer-organist Gregg Rolie in 1973 to form Journey; drummer Mike Shrieve and percussionist Mike Carabello. <a href="Santana (band)">Santana</a> said of Rolie, who played with Ringo Starr's All-Starr Band for the last two years, "I'm pretty sure Gregg's going to do it." In February 2013, Rolie told Radio.com, "it's just a matter of putting <a href="Santana (band)">it</a> together and going and doing it. I would do it. I think <a href="Santana (band)">it</a>'s a great idea. People would love it. <a href="Santana (band)">it</a> could be great!"
On 6 May 2014, <a href="Santana (band)">Santana</a> released a new studio album entitled " <a href="Corazón (Santana album)">Corazón</a>".
On 9 September 2014, <a href="Santana (band)">Santana</a> released a new live album entitled "Corazón – Live from Mexico: Live <a href="Santana (band)">it</a> To Believe It".

<doc title="Garry Parker">
<a href="Garry Parker">Garry Parker</a> (born 7 September 1965 in <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>) is an English former professional <a href="association football">footballer</a>. <a href="Garry Parker">he</a> is currently first team coach at <a href="Football League Championship">Championship</a> side <a href="Bolton Wanderers F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a>.
As a player <a href="Garry Parker">he</a> was a <a href="midfielder">midfielder</a> from 1983 to 2001, notably in the <a href="Premier League">Premier League</a> for <a href="Aston Villa F.C.">Aston Villa</a> and <a href="Leicester City F.C.">Leicester City</a>. <a href="Garry Parker">he</a> also played for <a href="Luton Town F.C.">Luton Town</a>, <a href="Hull City A.F.C.">Hull City</a> and <a href="Nottingham Forest F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>. <a href="Garry Parker">he</a> was <a href="cap (sport)">capped</a> by his country at <a href="England under-21 national football team">under-21</a> and <a href="England B national football team">B international</a> level. In 2001 <a href="Garry Parker">he</a> became caretaker manager of <a href="Leicester City F.C.">Leicester City</a>.
<a href="Garry Parker">Parker</a> was a cultured <a href="midfield">midfield</a> player through whom teams would gain their creativity in goalscoring chances. <a href="Garry Parker">he</a> signed as an apprentice with <a href="Luton Town F.C.">Luton Town</a> in 1982 and made his first team debut the following year.
<a href="Garry Parker">Parker</a>'s progress under <a href="David Pleat">David Pleat</a> at Luton was gradual owing to the presence in the midfield of <a href="England national football team">England</a> international <a href="Ricky Hill">Ricky Hill</a>. Although <a href="Garry Parker">Parker</a> featured in 33 League matches over the next two seasons – plus a starting place in the 1985 <a href="FA Cup">FA Cup</a> <a href="semi final">semi final</a> defeat to <a href="Everton F.C.">Everton</a> – <a href="Garry Parker">he</a> became frustrated at the lack of regular football and looked for a move in the summer of 1986.
<a href="Garry Parker">Parker</a> joined <a href="Hull City A.F.C.">Hull City</a>, a club outside the top flight, who were managed at the time by <a href="Garry Parker">Parker</a>'s former captain at Luton, <a href="Brian Horton">Brian Horton</a>. At Hull <a href="Garry Parker">he</a> was an automatic choice and rebuilt his career to the extent that <a href="Garry Parker">he</a> was called up to play for England at under-21 level. His only downside was a lack of goals – <a href="Garry Parker">he</a> didn't score at all in his first two seasons at Hull. His third season, however, racked up eight goals – including a memorable clincher at rivals <a href="Leeds United F.C.">Leeds United</a> and a free kick against <a href="Plymouth Argyle F.C.">Plymouth Argyle</a> in what turned out to be his last game for the club. A 260,000 <a href="pound sterling">pound</a> offer came in from <a href="Nottingham Forest F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>. This was accepted by Hull and so, in the spring of 1988, <a href="Garry Parker">Parker</a> was back in top-flight football.
<a href="Garry Parker">Parker</a> struggled to make the team initially at Forest, with <a href="Brian Clough">Brian Clough</a> preferring a partnership of England internationals <a href="Neil Webb">Neil Webb</a> and <a href="Steve Hodge">Steve Hodge</a> in the centre of midfield. However, over the <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a> period of 1988, <a href="Garry Parker">he</a> was given a role on the left wing and proved so successful that <a href="Garry Parker">he</a> stayed there for the rest of the season. <a href="Garry Parker">he</a> wasn't an orthodox <a href="winger (sport)">winger</a> – <a href="Garry Parker">he</a> didn't have great pace to beat full backs – but <a href="Garry Parker">he</a> had good crossing ability as well as his known eye for an incisive pass, and this galvanised Forest's midfield.
<a href="Garry Parker">Parker</a> won his first domestic honour that season as Forest won the <a href="Football League Cup">League Cup</a> at <a href="Wembley Stadium (1923)">Wembley</a>, beating his old club Luton. <a href="Garry Parker">he</a> had scored the winning goal in the semi final against <a href="Bristol City F.C.">Bristol City</a>. A week after winning the League Cup, <a href="Garry Parker">he</a> was in the Forest team which took to the field for an FA Cup semi final against <a href="Liverpool F.C.">Liverpool</a> which was abandoned as the <a href="Hillsborough disaster">Hillsborough disaster</a> unfolded. <a href="Garry Parker">he</a> was in the team for the game when it was re-scheduled at <a href="Old Trafford (football)">Old Trafford</a>, although Forest lost 3–1 and <a href="Garry Parker">he</a> was substituted.
<a href="Garry Parker">he</a> also scored twice at Wembley as Forest took the dimly-remembered <a href="Full Members Cup">Full Members Cup</a> in a 4–3 win over Everton. One of <a href="Garry Parker">Parker</a>'s goals was a full-length run of the Wembley pitch with the ball at his feet after it was cleared to him on the edge of his own penalty area. But for the relative insignificance of the occasion, the goal would be recalled as one of the stadium's best.
Webb left Forest for <a href="Manchester United F.C.">Manchester United</a> that summer and Clough paid <a href="Leeds United F.C.">Leeds United</a> three-quarters of a million pounds for <a href="John Sheridan (footballer)">John Sheridan</a>, a <a href="Republic of Ireland national football team">Republic of Ireland</a> international midfielder as an earmarked replacement, but <a href="Garry Parker">Parker</a> had already taken a chance to fill Webb's role in the centre of midfield – his preferred position – and Sheridan was unable to get a game. Three months later <a href="Garry Parker">he</a> was sold on to <a href="Sheffield Wednesday F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a> and <a href="Garry Parker">Parker</a> remained in place. <a href="Garry Parker">he</a> was in the side as Forest retained the League Cup at Wembley with a 1–0 win over <a href="Oldham Athletic F.C.">Oldham Athletic</a>.
The next season, <a href="Garry Parker">Parker</a> maintained his midfield place and when a teenage Irish midfielder called <a href="Roy Keane">Roy Keane</a> emerged at Forest, again it was the international star – this time Hodge – and not <a href="Garry Parker">Parker</a> who made way in the midfield. <a href="Garry Parker">Parker</a> played one of his best games for Forest as they defeated <a href="West Ham United F.C.">West Ham United</a> 4–0 in the FA Cup semi final. It was his third such game and the first in which <a href="Garry Parker">he</a> had emerged victorious.
The following season, <a href="Garry Parker">Parker</a> was sold to <a href="Aston Villa F.C.">Aston Villa</a> and was a hit in their midfield, contributing to the team which came close to winning the <a href="FA Premier League">FA Premier League</a> in 1993. <a href="Garry Parker">he</a> later struggled to maintain a place in the side under <a href="Ron Atkinson">Ron Atkinson</a> and was sold in February 1995 to <a href="Leicester City F.C.">Leicester City</a>, by which time <a href="Brian Little (footballer)">Brian Little</a> had taken over from the dismissed Atkinson.
His first season ended in relegation, but they bounced back through the play-offs the following year , and <a href="Garry Parker">Parker</a> won his third League Cup winners medal when Leicester defeated <a href="Middlesbrough F.C.">Middlesbrough</a> in the 1997 final after a replay.
<a href="Garry Parker">Parker</a>'s last game for Leicester was on 30 January 1999 at Middlesbrough.
In the <a href="1990–91 in English football">1990/91 season</a>, <a href="Garry Parker">Parker</a> was called up once by England coach <a href="Graham Taylor (footballer)">Graham Taylor</a> to the full squad, although <a href="Garry Parker">he</a> didn't feature in the team and never won a full cap, although a number of appearances at 'B' level came his way.
<a href="Garry Parker">Parker</a> retired as a player and joined the coaching staff at Leicester after a brief spell as a peg salesman. <a href="Garry Parker">he</a> took over briefly as caretaker manager after the sacking of <a href="Peter John Taylor">Peter Taylor</a> in 2001. His only match in charge was a 6–0 <a href="Football League Cup">League Cup</a> loss to <a href="Leeds United A.F.C.">Leeds United</a>.
On 1 July 2010 the new <a href="Celtic F.C.">Celtic</a> manager <a href="Neil Lennon">Neil Lennon</a> appointed <a href="Garry Parker">Parker</a> a former team-mate at <a href="Leicester City F.C.">Leicester City</a>, as a first team coach at Celtic.
On 12 October 2014 <a href="Garry Parker">he</a> joined <a href="Bolton Wanderers F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> as First Team Coach, linking up once again with former Celtic colleagues Neil Lennon and Johan Mjallby.

<a href="Salim Tuama">Tuama</a> has lived his entire life in the city of <a href="Lod">Lod</a>, yet began his career using the facilities of the Gadna club due to the poor conditions of the local fields and football schools in Lod.
<a href="Salim Tuama">Tuama</a> became the hottest prospect in Israeli football in the 1998–99 season when <a href="Salim Tuama">he</a> along with wonderkids Kfir Udi, <a href="Omri Afek">Omri Afek</a>, and <a href="Pini Balili">Pini Balili</a>, all of whom had been harvested by renowned Israeli manager <a href="Dror Kashtan">Dror Kashtan</a>, led Hapoel to their first State Cup title since 1983, following by a double on the next season 1999–2000.

In the same season <a href="Salim Tuama">he</a> returned to Maccabi Petah Tikva to help them log in perhaps their most impressive finish, second place and a ticket to the <a href="UEFA Cup">UEFA Cup</a>.
After a disappointing 2005–06 season with Maccabi Petah Tikva, in which <a href="Salim Tuama">Tuama</a> had to shoulder the team almost single-handedly at times after a great start in the UEFA Cup qualifiers, <a href="Salim Tuama">he</a> signed back with <a href="Hapoel Tel Aviv F.C.">Hapoel Tel Aviv</a>. On June 28, 2007, Toama had signed a three-year contract with <a href="Standard Liège">Standard Liège</a>.
<a href="Salim Tuama">Tuama</a> left Belgium after two seasons at <a href="Standard Liège">Standard Liège</a>, as <a href="Salim Tuama">he</a> was injured for many parts of his second season there, and did not get many chances. <a href="Salim Tuama">he</a> signed for Greek side <a href="Larissa F.C.">Larissa</a> and spent one season there, scoring 2 goals. At the end of the 2009–10 season, <a href="Salim Tuama">Tuama</a> Returned to Israel and signed, for the third time in his career, with then double holders Hapoel Tel Aviv. <a href="Salim Tuama">he</a> Scored the winning goal in a 1–0 victory over newly crowned <a href="Israeli Premier League">champions</a> <a href="Maccabi Haifa F.C.">Maccabi Haifa</a> at the <a href="Israeli State Cup">Israeli State Cup</a> final of 2010–11.
