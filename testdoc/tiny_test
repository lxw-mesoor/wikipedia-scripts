Etymology and terminology.
The term "<a href="wikt:anarchism">anarchism</a>" is a compound word composed from the word "<a href="anarchy">anarchy</a>" and the suffix "<a href="-ism">-ism</a>", themselves derived respectively from the Greek , i.e. "anarchy" (from , "anarchos", meaning "one without rulers"; from the <a href="privative">privative</a> prefix <a href="privative alpha">ἀν</a>- ("an-", i.e. "without") and , "archos", i.e. "leader", "ruler"; (cf. "<a href="archon">archon</a>" or , "arkhē", i.e. "authority", "sovereignty", "realm", "magistracy")) and the suffix or ("-ismos", "-isma", from the verbal <a href="infinitive">infinitive</a> suffix -ίζειν, "-izein"). The first known use of this word was in 1539. Various factions within the <a href="French Revolution">French Revolution</a> labelled opponents as anarchists (as <a href="Maximilien de Robespierre">Robespierre</a> did the <a href="Hébertists">Hébertists</a>) although few shared many views of later anarchists. There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, such as <a href="William Godwin">William Godwin</a> and <a href="Wilhelm Weitling">Wilhelm Weitling</a>, but they did not use the word "anarchist" or "anarchism" in describing themselves or their beliefs.
Criticisms.
Criticisms of anarchism include <a href="morality">moral</a> criticisms and pragmatic criticisms. Anarchism is often evaluated as unfeasible or <a href="utopian">utopian</a> by its critics. European history professor Carl Landauer, in his book "European Socialism" argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a "lesser evil" than a society without "repressive force." He also argued that "ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears" is an "absurdity."
