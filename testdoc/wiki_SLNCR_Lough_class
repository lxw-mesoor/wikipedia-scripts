SLNCR Lough class


The <a href="SLNCR Lough class">SLNCR Lough Class</a> was a class of <a href="0-6-4">0-6-4T</a> steam <a href="tank locomotive">tank locomotives</a> of the <a href="Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway">Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway</a> (SLNCR).
Development.
By the end of <a href="World War II">Second World War</a> the SLNCR's locomotive fleet was in poor condition, but neither the <a href="Great Northern Railway (Ireland)">Great Northern</a> nor <a href="CIÉ">Córas Iompair Éireann</a> could spare any suitable locomotives for hire. The SLNCR considered ordering a <a href="Garratt">Garratt</a> <a href="articulated locomotive">articulated locomotive</a> to haul heavier trains, but it could scarcely afford one locomotive of such a large size. Therefore, it decided instead to order two more smaller locomotives, on the basis that if one required maintenance the other could still be available for traffic.
In June 1946 the SLNCR ordered just one new locomotive from <a href="Beyer, Peacock and Company">Beyer, Peacock and Company</a> at <a href="Gorton Foundry">Gorton Foundry</a>, <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, England. The SLNCR's financial situation was worsening, but despite this it ordered the second locomotive about a year later. The "Lough" class was a more modern and more powerful development of the <a href="SLNCR Sir Henry class">"Sir Henry" class</a>, which was also built by Beyer, Peacock but was introduced in 1904.
Delivery and SLNCR service.
Beyer, Peacock completed both locomotives ready for delivery in spring 1949 but by then the SLNCR could not afford to pay for them. The SLNCR therefore asked the <a href="Government of Northern Ireland">Government of Northern Ireland</a>'s Ministry of Commerce to lend it £22,000 to pay for the two locomotives. Protracted negotiations between the SLNCR, Ministry of Commerce and Beyer, Peacock eventually resulted in a <a href="hire purchase">hire purchase</a> agreement in 1951, and the two locomotives were shipped from England to <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a> in June and July of that year. They were taken first to the GNR's Adelaide <a href="Motive power depot">locomotive depot</a> in Belfast, where their side tanks were fitted. They were then delivered to the SLNCR's locomotive depot at , <a href="County Leitrim">County Leitrim</a>.
The "Lough" class became the last new steam locomotives to enter revenue-earning service with an Irish railway company. <a href="CIÉ No. CC1">CIÉ's turf-burning locomotive</a> entered traffic later, but remained experimental and never entered revenue-earning service. The "Loughs" could haul trains 25% heavier than the "Sir Henrys", and they were worked hard from 1951 until the SLNCR's closure.
The SLNCR had never prospered, and in 1957 it closed to all traffic. On Monday 30 September 1957 "Lough Melvin" hauled the company's last service, a <a href="mixed train">mixed train</a> from Eniskillen to Sligo.
SLNCR livery.
By the 1950s the SLNCR's locomotive livery was unlined black. Brasswork was also painted black but the borders and lettering of the locomotive <a href="nameplate">nameplate</a><a href="">s</a> were picked out in red. <a href="Coupling rod">Coupling rods</a> and <a href="buffer beams">buffer beams</a> were also painted red.
Identification.
The SLNCR did not number its steam locomotives but named them. The "Lough" Class were named "<a href="Lough Melvin">Lough Melvin</a>" and "<a href="Lough Erne">Lough Erne</a>".

(a) : Beyer, Peacock & Co. works numbers 7136/7/8 were originally allocated to three <a href="War Department (United Kingdom)">War Department</a> Garratt locomotives. This order was cancelled, 7136 and 7137 were re-allocated to two extra Garratts for the <a href="Great Western Railway of Brazil">Great Western Railway of Brazil</a>, added to a delayed pre-war order sub-contracted to <a href="Henschel & Son">Henschel & Son</a>.
(b) : The last tank locomotive built by Beyer Peacock & Co., order No.1427.
Sale and UTA service.
When the SLNCR closed at the end of September 1957 the "Loughs" were still on hire purchase from their builders. Beyer, Peacock eventually sold the pair in 1959 to the <a href="Ulster Transport Authority">Ulster Transport Authority</a> (UTA).
The UTA designated the "Loughs" Class Z and numbered them 26 and 27, but they continued to carry their names and nameplates. For a short while the UTA allocated both locomotives to Adelaide shed for service as shunters on the quays and Grosvenor Road goods yard. It then transferred them to York Road, where they eventually replaced <a href="NCC Class Y">NCC Class Y</a>.
On 28 May 1960, locomotive 26 "Lough Melvin" hauled a two-coach <a href="Irish Railway Record Society">Irish Railway Record Society</a> special train from Belfast <a href="Yorkgate railway station">Belfast York Road</a> to , and "via" the former <a href="Belfast Central Railway">Belfast Central Railway</a> to <a href="Queen's Quay, Belfast">Belfast Queen's Quay</a>, the tour eventually terminating at . This was recorded as the first passenger working of an ex-SLNCR locomotive in the ownership of the UTA.
The UTA withdrew 26 "Lough Melvin" from service in 1965 but did not dispose of it. <a href="Northern Ireland Railways">Northern Ireland Railways</a> (NIR) took over the UTA's railway operations in 1967 and sold "Lough Melvin" for scrap in 1968. NIR withdrew 27 "Lough Erne" in 1969.
Preservation.
The <a href="Railway Preservation Society of Ireland">Railway Preservation Society of Ireland</a> bought "Lough Erne" and used it to shunt its yard at Whitehead until its boiler failed in 1972. "Lough Erne" remains at Whitehead awaiting extensive restoration.
